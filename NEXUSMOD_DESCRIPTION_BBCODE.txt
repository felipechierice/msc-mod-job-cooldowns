[center][size=4][b]Job Cooldowns v1.1.0[/b][/size]
[color=#ffa500]As with any mod that modifies game mechanics, it's recommended to backup your save before use.[/color][/center]

[size=6][b]Job Cooldowns[/b][/size]

Configure cooldown times for all major jobs in My Summer Car. Make jobs available instantly, keep vanilla timings, or slow them down to match your playstyle.

I created this mod because I found the firewood job cooldown too long (8 hours). With limited gaming time, waiting that long made the game less enjoyable for me. Now I can reduce it to 2 hours for a more relaxed gameplay experience.
